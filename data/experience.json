        "description": "Worked on algorithm engineering problems at the intersection of theory and practice, focusing on knapsack and coin change variants. Synthesized ideas from seven theoretical papers into a unified C++ implementation pipeline. Reconstructed omitted implementation details and identified structural bottlenecks in the theoretical designs. Developed original randomized variants to improve practical performance, achieving up to 20× empirical speedups, and conducted experiments to validate theoretical guarantees."

        "description": "Redesigned a safety-aware navigation system (Safemaps) by modeling risk as weighted edges rather than removing unsafe nodes. This allowed for a principled balance between safety and path efficiency while significantly improving algorithm runtime. Led a team of five students in implementing weighted A* heuristics and helped shape the overall algorithmic direction of the project."

Developed a Unity-based 3D maze game and designed adaptive maze-generation algorithms using DFS/BFS heuristics and knapsack-based difficulty control. Co-authored a paper published in GMU’s Journal of Student Scientists."
